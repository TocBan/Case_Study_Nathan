# Module 1 Challenge
## What is the name of the company?
Apple Inc.
# When was the company incorporated?
Apple was founded as Apple Computer Company on April 1, 1976.
# Who are the founders of the company?
Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne 
# How did the idea for the project come about?
The Apple Pay idea came about because Apple wanted to digitise their customers wallets
and allow them to carry and use all of their payment cards, loyalty cards, car keys, tickets,
boarding passes and other cards, more securely on iPhones and Apple Watches.

Apple Pay was a top-secret project that had been in preparation for a long time prior to Apple partnering with American Express, MasterCard, and Visa. Their joint project began in January 2013.

Apple Pay utilizes the technology, NFC (Near Field Communication).
It is a technology that enables users to securely transmit and receive information through their phones over a short-range (usually 4 cm). NFC is an upgrade of the existing RFID technology, which combines both the reader and the smartcard interface into a single
device.
# How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
In 1977, right after Steve Wozniak co-founded Apple with Steve Jobs in a Silicon Valley garage, the company raised $250,000 from Mike Markkula, an angel investor and Apples second CEO. That was followed by three rounds of funding from well-known VCs including Venrock, Sequoia Capital, Morgenthaler, Matrix Partners and Brentwood VentureCapital. Apples late stage financing was minimal compared to the massive tech investments seen now, but a couple million wasnt considered too shabby in 1980. Shortly thereafter came Apples IPO, on Dec. 12, 1980. The company offered 4.6 million shares priced at $14, which opened at $22 apiece on the NASDAQ and soared up to $29 that first day of trading. And from there, the rest was history—Apple shares closed yesterday at $682.98.

# What specific financial problem is the project trying to solve?
# How does NFC Payments Work?
When both reader and payment devices are close together and activated, then there is an exchange of encrypted data from the NFC chips, which complete the payment.

This process makes the checkout flow lightning-fast, thus making NFC payments as one of the most secure and convenient payment methods. This is the reason why NFC-powered
payments such as Android Pay and Apple Pay are becoming a preferred payment option for consumers.

The contactless connection between the two devices is established with the help of radio waves, which are similar to RFID labels that are used in warehouse, store, and other wireless tracking applications. NFC chips use a specific RFID frequency of 13.56MHz that works only when both the chips are placed very close to each other.

Many digital eWallet payment apps use NFC for added security as digital wallets only communicate with NFC readers when the user unlocks the app on the device and selects the payment card to be used for payment.

Another security feature of NFC is that the NFC readers connect with only one NFC payment device at a time. This eliminates all the possibilities of a nearby customer accidentally paying for someone else’s purchase.

NFC also allows its users to store multiple debit and credit cards on their mobile devices.
With this, the users no longer need to carry cards in their wallets.

Some of the Leading NFC payment applications are:
* Google Pay
* Apple Pay
* LifeLock Wallet
* MasterCard PayPass
* Visa payWave

Using mobile wallets is a more secure option than carrying physical cards. It’s because these digital ewallet apps like Apple pay tokenize all your bank details into something that can’t be accessed or used by the fraudsters.

So, even if your mobile phone gets stolen, all your credit cards and other valuable details stay protected.

Some of the advantages of using Apple Pay:
* More secure
* Convenient
* Versatile
